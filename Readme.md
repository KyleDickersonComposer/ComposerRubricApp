This app is designed to be a way for a composer to diagnose their state within the current media composer industry and evaluate their skills for a propective career.

The areas of evaluation are:

- Technical Skill (DAW/Notation)
- Mock-ups and Production Skill
- Arranging and Orchestration Skill
- Online Presence

A rubric will be generated so that a prospective composer may evaluate themselves. 

Hopefully this app will give the composer some advice for improvement and resources to aid them.
